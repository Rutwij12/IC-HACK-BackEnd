1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,610
Let's explore functions, starting with y equals 2x. Watch as we plot this

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,069
line and see how each input x gives us an output y that's

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,372
twice its value. For example, when x is 1, y becomes 2.

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:18,072
Let's explore a single artificial neuron - the building block

5
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,231
of neural networks. As we draw it, notice how inputs

6
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:25,241
flow through weighted connections into the neuron body, which then

7
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:28,886
processes and outputs a signal using an activation function.

8
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:32,245
Here's our neural network with three layers. Input nodes

9
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:35,504
in blue receive data, which flows through green hidden

10
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:38,762
nodes, and finally reaches red output nodes - creating

11
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,538
a complete pathway for information processing.

12
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:46,930
Let's see how a simple neural network learns. Starting with two

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,929
weights connecting three nodes, we'll process an input of 2 to

14
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:55,186
predict an output. After seeing the error, the network adjusts its

15
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:58,346
weights to get closer to the desired result of 1.

16
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:03,714
Here's a written digit 7, passed through a neural network.

17
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,496
As the pixels flow into input nodes, they connect through

18
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:11,344
a hidden layer, leading to ten possible digit outputs. The

19
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:14,794
network confidently identifies this as the number 7.
