1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,715
Let's explore a two-by-two matrix where each row represents a

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:07,030
point in space. As we highlight these rows, watch how

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,532
they map directly to coordinates on our grid, creating a

4
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:14,348
visual connection between matrix values and geometric points.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,266
When multiplying matrices, we start with a 2 by 3 matrix A

6
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:22,000
and a 3 by 2 matrix B. Notice how their inner dimensions

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,666
both equal 3 - this matching is essential for matrix multiplication to

8
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,400
work. The result will be a 2 by 2 matrix.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,715
Let's see how a single element in matrix multiplication is computed through the

10
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:40,426
dot product. When we multiply these matrices, we take the row values 2

11
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:44,665
and 3, and multiply them with the column values 4 and 5. Adding

12
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,232
the products together gives us our final value of 23.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,049
Let's multiply these two matrices by calculating each element one at

14
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,468
a time. Watch how we multiply the rows of matrix A

15
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:59,956
by the columns of matrix B to form our result. Each

16
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:04,264
new number we calculate fills one position in our final matrix.

17
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:08,324
Let's start by looking at point P at coordinates (2,1). When

18
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:12,482
we apply a 45-degree rotation matrix, we can follow the point

19
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:16,505
as it rotates around the origin, ending at its new position

20
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:22,436
P-prime at approximately (0.7, 2.1). This transformation preserves the point's distance

21
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,641
from the origin while changing its orientation.
