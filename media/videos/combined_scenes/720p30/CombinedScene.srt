1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,247
In linear algebra, we can perform row operations on matrices.

2
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:07,240
When we subtract half of row 1 from row 2,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,516
we create an equivalent system that preserves all solutions.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,700
In elementary row operations, we can swap any two rows. Watch as

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,112
we swap rows 1 and 2 of this matrix, moving the rows

6
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:24,100
into their new positions while maintaining the rest of the matrix unchanged.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,928
We multiply each element in the first row by 2, transforming

8
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:32,619
the values. Watch as 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8, and

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,236
1 becomes 2, while the other rows stay unchanged.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,652
When we add one row to another in a matrix, we add the numbers in

11
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:51,305
each position. Watch as we add Row 1 to Row 2, combining 3 plus 2

12
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,384
and 4 plus 1 to get our new row of 5 and 5.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,995
Lets simplify this matrix by performing row operations. We multiply the first

14
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,498
row by one half and subtract it from the second row to

15
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:10,456
obtain zeros below our pivot, giving us our row echelon form.
