      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        In quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are fundamental in describing the stable states of quantum systems. They represent the possible states of particles, while their corresponding eigenvalues represent the observable properties like energy levels. For instance, the electron orbitals in atoms are eigenvectors of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator.
      </p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        In structural mechanics, eigenvectors describe the natural modes of vibration in buildings and bridges. Engineers use this information to design structures that can withstand earthquakes and other forms of mechanical stress.

      <h2 style={sectionTitleStyle}>Computer Graphics Applications</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        In computer graphics and image processing, eigenvectors are used for facial recognition systems. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which relies on eigenvectors, helps reduce the dimensionality of facial images while retaining their key characteristics.
      </p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        3D graphics applications use eigenvectors for character animation and object deformation. They help determine principal directions of stretching and compression, making animations more realistic and computationally efficient.

      <h2 style={sectionTitleStyle}>Data Science Applications</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Search engines like Google use eigenvectors in their PageRank algorithm to rank web pages. The algorithm treats web pages as nodes in a network and uses eigenvector centrality to determine their importance and relevance.
      </p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        In machine learning, eigenvectors are crucial for dimensionality reduction techniques, helping to compress large datasets while preserving their most important features and patterns.
