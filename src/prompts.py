The videos will explain topics that may be complicated, so the video must walk them through step by step so that they can go from not knowing much to feeling really confident about the topic.
The scenes should begin with one or two on pre requesitues before going into the main topic
Generate high level descriptions 4-6 scenes that will effectively teach the concept.  
These high level descriptions are then going to be used to plan the scenes in more detail, before finally coding them up.
Each scene must be completely independepent, don't mention other scenes when describing a particular scene
Each scene should focus on one key idea or step in the explanation, and should end up being around 15 seconds long.
The scenes should only have a few elements present at a time, and should not be very complex to implement. Things that are complex to implement for example try to demonstrate complicated real world objects within manim, which is quite hard to do

You will be given a scene outline and description, you need to flesh out the details a little more so it will be easy to translate to manim code 
Clearly think about how items should be displayed on the screen, and where they should be displayed. 
If there are examples, make sure that the numbers used and mathematics are actually rigorous and correct and demonstrate the concepts correctly.
Make sure the numbers / vectors / matrices to be used have been described.
The coder should not have much work to do. Clearly describe how items should fade in and out, and what elements are displayed at what points.
Items that are on the screen should be clearly displyed and non overlapping. If there are different parts to the scene.
Make sure all the elements of the scene are faded out before the new elements are introduced in the centre of the screen."""

COMBINATION_STEP_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """Adding Voiceovers to Videos
Creating a full-fledged video with voiceovers is a bit more involved than creating purely visual Manim scenes. One has to use a video editing program to add the voiceovers after the video has been rendered. This process can be difficult and time-consuming, since it requires a lot of planning and preparation.

To ease the process of adding voiceovers to videos, we have created Manim Voiceover, a plugin that lets you add voiceovers to scenes directly in Python. To install it, run

pip install "manim-voiceover[azure,gtts]"
Visit the installation page for more details on how to install Manim Voiceover.

Basic Usage
Manim Voiceover lets you â€¦

Add voiceovers to Manim videos directly in Python, without having to use a video editor.

Record voiceovers with your microphone during rendering through a simple command line interface.

Develop animations with auto-generated AI voices from various free and proprietary services.

It provides a very simple API that lets you specify your voiceover script and then record it during rendering:

from manim import *
from manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene
from manim_voiceover.services.recorder import RecorderService


# Simply inherit from VoiceoverScene instead of Scene to get all the
# voiceover functionality.
class RecorderExample(VoiceoverScene):
    def construct(self):
        # You can choose from a multitude of TTS services,
        # or in this example, record your own voice:
        self.set_speech_service(RecorderService())

        circle = Circle()

        # Surround animation sections with with-statements:
        with self.voiceover(text="This circle is drawn as I speak.") as tracker:
            self.play(Create(circle), run_time=tracker.duration)
            # The duration of the animation is received from the audio file
            # and passed to the tracker automatically.

        # This part will not start playing until the previous voiceover is finished.
        with self.voiceover(text="Let's shift it to the left 2 units.") as tracker:
            self.play(circle.animate.shift(2 * LEFT), run_time=tracker.duration)
To get started with Manim Voiceover, visit the Quick Start Guide.

The above documentation describes how to add voiceover to a manim scene.
You will be given some manim scenes and voiceovers associated to each scene.
You need to create a big scene that is the combination of all the smaller scenes. With the voiceover over the associated part of the video.

1. Inherits from VoiceoverScene
2. Uses OpenAI TTS for voiceovers
3. Properly transitions between scenes by fading out all elements
4. Maintains proper timing and synchronization
5. Preserves all the animation logic from the original scenes

It is crucial and fundamental that you output the full code of the whole script. You must include every line and keep the logic the same
