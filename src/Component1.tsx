        One of the most influential and enigmatic figures in ancient Greek philosophy and mathematics, Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE) left an indelible mark on human thought that resonates to this day.

        Born on the island of Samos, Pythagoras founded a philosophical and religious school in Croton, Italy, where he developed his famous mathematical theories and cultivated a devoted following. His teachings extended far beyond mathematics into music, astronomy, and metaphysics.

        While he is most commonly known for the Pythagorean theorem, his influence spans much broader - from his belief in the mathematical nature of reality to his teachings on the immortality of the soul. His ideas would later influence great thinkers like Plato and continue to shape our understanding of mathematics and philosophy.
